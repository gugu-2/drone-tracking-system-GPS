# FPV Drone Tracking System

I've created a comprehensive FPV drone tracking system that includes all the essential features a drone operator would need. The system has been completely fixed and is now fully functional with real-time backend-frontend communication.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start the System:**
```bash
python start_drone_system.py
```

3. **Access the Interface:**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The system will automatically connect via WebSocket

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

- **Complete Backend Implementation** - Full Python backend with WebSocket support
- **Real-time Communication** - Frontend now connects to backend via WebSocket
- **Database Integration** - SQLite database for flight data storage
- **Error Handling** - Robust error handling throughout the system
- **Dependency Management** - Proper requirements.txt and dependency checking
- **Configuration** - JSON-based configuration system
